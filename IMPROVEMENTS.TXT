* minUP should be run from everywhere 
** I thing this is a design mistake when running in a server environment. I fixed minUP.py dependency to its subfolder 'modules' so we can run it from everywhere and do not have to be in the minUP folder all the time

* minUP should allow adding custom minUP Linux Config files (custom filenames and folders)
** I think this is a design mistake when running in a server environment. The minUP config files should not be in the minUP folder where the binaries are because I put these binaries in a system bin folder where not everybody should have permissions to change anything. Also the config file contains run specific data it should be possible to use variable config files as runtime parameter so we can keep a series of different config files for different users / runs / projects.
** adding a minUP configuration file can be used by the non-mandantory parameter -a or --configfile, if you do not define this parameter the standard 'minup_posix.config' file will be used in the standard dir.

** since I have it made possible to run minUP.py from everywhere and in the standard script all the output files will be written to the folder where minUP.py lives I included another parameter called -e or --outputdir which makes it possible to define a location where all the log files, last and bwa indexes as well as valid_reference_fasta_files will be written to. This is also very important since I want to make it possible to run the alignment part of minUP in a clustered environment such as openpbs/torque. Here the index files and other data needs to be accessible from everywhere (every node) as I use a NFS share to share data between nodes.
